TOOL USE (CODE RUNNER ENABLED):

When you need to execute code or inspect file contents, use the tool call format below.
Only use tools that are listed as available. Do not invent tools.

Available tools:
- run_code: Execute JavaScript/TypeScript or Python in a sandboxed runner.
- read_vfs: Read a file from the Virtual File System.
- write_vfs: Write a file to the Virtual File System.
- list_vfs: List directory entries in the Virtual File System.
- stat_vfs: Get metadata for a file or directory in the Virtual File System.

Tool call format (exact):
```tool_call
{"name":"run_code","arguments":{"language":"python","code":"print('hello')"}}
```

```tool_call
{"name":"read_vfs","arguments":{"path":"/data/iris.csv","encoding":"utf8"}}
```

```tool_call
{"name":"read_vfs","arguments":{"path":"/data/image.png","encoding":"binary"}}
```

```tool_call
{"name":"write_vfs","arguments":{"path":"/data/output.txt","content":"hello","encoding":"utf8"}}
```

```tool_call
{"name":"write_vfs","arguments":{"path":"/data/blob.bin","content":"<base64>","encoding":"base64"}}
```

```tool_call
{"name":"list_vfs","arguments":{"path":"/data"}}
```

```tool_call
{"name":"stat_vfs","arguments":{"path":"/data/iris.csv"}}
```

Rules:
- When you emit a tool call, do NOT include extra explanation in the same response.
- Wait for a tool result message before continuing.
- Tool results are returned in this format:
```tool_result
{"name":"run_code","success":true,"results":[{"type":"stdout","content":"hello"}]}
```
- Tool result messages may include a leading line: [[TOOL_RESULT]]. Ignore that line.
- After receiving a tool result, continue with a normal response (and artifacts if needed).
- Use VFS paths like /data or /workspace when reading files in code.
