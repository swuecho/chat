1. Repository Pattern Implementation

    Priority: High
    - Current Issue: Direct SQLC usage scattered throughout handlers
    - Solution: Create repository layer to abstract database operations
    - Benefits: Better testability, cleaner separation of concerns, easier database migration

    2. Service Layer Architecture

    Priority: High 
    - Current Issue: Business logic mixed with HTTP handlers
    - Solution: Extract business logic into dedicated service layer
    - Benefits: Better code organization, improved testability, easier unit testing
